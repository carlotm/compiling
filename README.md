# Compiling

When I was a child, my sister showed me this puzzle,
it's a puzzle game to play while compiling (https://xkcd.com/303).

Warning: I don't know if the puzzle actually has a solution.

[Play the game](https://carlotm.github.io/compiling)

Rules are:

- Move the cursor with `hjkl` or arrow keys
- `space` to put a value in the current cell
- Put the next value horizontally or vertically skipping 2 cells or diagonally skipping 1 cell (the UI will help finding the possible moves)

## Local development

This app uses [devbox](https://www.jetpack.io/devbox/).

Use `devbox shell` to download the requirements and activate the development environment.

Use `make` to build the app in the `_site` folder.

Open `_site/index.html` in your favorite web browser.

Cheers!
